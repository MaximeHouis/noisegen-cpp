# perlin-noise-generator
###### Cross-Platform Perlin Noise Generator written in C++, just for fun :)

### Supported platforms
* Linux
* Windows
* macOS\*

> \* *Clang and Apple-Clang do not support `std::execution` yet.
> This will make the program/lib way slower.
> I tried using gcc on macOS, but I had dependency compiling issues. (can only test through GitHub Actions)
> Contributions to improve this are welcome.
