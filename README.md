# noisegen-cpp
###### Cross-Platform Perlin Noise Generator written in C++, just for fun :)

### Supported platforms
* Linux
* Windows
* macOS\*

> \* *Clang and Apple-Clang do not support `std::execution` yet.  
> This will make the program/lib way slower on macOS / clang builds.  
> I tried using gcc on macOS, but I had dependency compiling issues. (can only test through GitHub Actions)*
